## Making a release of Reko

### Preparation
Use `git log <tag-of-last-version>..HEAD` on the `master` branch to collect log information

Edit log information to highlight major features and fixes 

Collect the names of contributors for acknowledgement

### Versioning
Decide on a new version number x.x.x.x
Change the string constants `src/Core/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` file to the new version
Change the assembly versions in `src/tools/xslt/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
Change the assembly versions in `src/tools/makesigs/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
Change the appveyor build version in `appevor.yml`
Change the MSI Installer version in `src/WixInstaller/Properties.wxi`
Change the MSI Installer version in `src/WixInstaller/WixInstaller.wixproj`

Build from a fresh clone of the Reko repository to make sure all project build without errors.
Run all unit tests, run all regression tests.
Commit changes and push to GitHub, triggering the CI builds on AppVeyor and Travis-CI.
Make sure CI tests are are passing.

## Final steps
$TODO: The following could probably be automated with a script.

Create a new tag: 'version-x.x.x.x`
Push tag to `master` on Github

Copy the distributables (msi files)
Go to https://github.com/uxmal/reko/releases and make a new release
